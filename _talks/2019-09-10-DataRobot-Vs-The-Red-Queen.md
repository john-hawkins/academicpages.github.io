In this talk I gave a brief overview of the Red Queen effect that has been
used in evolutionary biology to describe co-evolution of competing species.
I apply this idea to the competition betweenm organisations that are using
data science and machine learning to differentiate against their competitors.

Organisations that compete on analytics find themselves also competing for the 
human talent to build and deploy machine learning solutions. This means that any
technology that is able to improve the productiveity of data scientists and 
allow other organisations to leverage machine learning will lend a significant 
advantage to the organisations that are able to use it.
