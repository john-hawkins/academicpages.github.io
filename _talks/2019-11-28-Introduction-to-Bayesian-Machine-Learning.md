In this invited talk for the Machine Learning & Deep Learning Day
I presented a ground-up introduction to understanding the fundamentals of
Bayesian Machine Learning. I introduced the idea of Bayesian statistics
and described the connections between maximum likelihood, maxium a-posteriori
and finally the Bayesian goal of a complete estimate of the posterior distribution.
I introduced Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm.
Finally I share some brief cautions on how people from freqeuntist machine learning
tend to go wrong either through their expectations or implementations.
