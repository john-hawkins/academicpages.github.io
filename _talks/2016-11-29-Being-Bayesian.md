In this Sydney Data Science Meet-Up talk I gave an overview of the
history and reasoning that lead to the distinction beetwen Frequentist
and Bayesian Inference. I give several worked examples and show the 
results of simulations designed to answer the question under which 
circumstances should we prefer one over the other.
