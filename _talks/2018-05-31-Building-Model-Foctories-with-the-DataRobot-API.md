In this Sydney Data Science Sponsored Meet-Up talk I gave an 
introduction of the idea of Model Factories, discussing the history of 
the idea and how it has lead to AutoML systems like DataRobot. 
Ultimately enabling us to build new forms of automated ML systems.

I discuss the difficulties in deploying a fully automated model deployment system.
Describing the kinds of difficult model selection decisions that need to be converted
into an algorithm. I delve into several examples of business problems, and 
discuss some of the related issues. I then describe how you can bootstrap
your way into developing effective Model Factories by using an
AutoML system like DataRobot.

Finally I share some coe examples of how to approach this use the DataRobot API.
