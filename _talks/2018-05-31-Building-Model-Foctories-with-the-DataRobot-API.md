In this Sydney Data Science Sponsored Meet-Up talk I gave an 
introduction of the idea of Model Factories, discussing the history of 
the idea and how it has lead to AutoML.

I then discussed how there are still many difficulties in fully 
deploying a Model Factory as a solution to many business problems, and 
discuss some of these issues. I then describe how you can bootstrap
your way into developing effective Model Factories by using an
AutoML system like DataRobot.

Finally I share some coe examples of how to approach this use the DataRobot API.
