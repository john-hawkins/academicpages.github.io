In this talk I summarised the content delivered at the workshop I attended
on Evolutionary Game Theory with G-functions. The workshop was given by
Tom Vincent  at the University of Adelaide. Based on his book 
[Evolutionary Game Theory, Natural Selection, and Darwinian Dynamics](https://www.amazon.com/Evolutionary-Natural-Selection-Darwinian-Dynamics/dp/0521841704)
