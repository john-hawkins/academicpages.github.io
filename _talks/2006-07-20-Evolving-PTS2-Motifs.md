In this talk I presented the work done with Mikael Boden on the task of designing
evolutioning algorithms to create regular expression like motifs to distinguish 
proteins that carry the PTS2 motif. This is a difficult classification task due
to the absence of large data sets and highly variable sequences in the signalling
section of the proteins.
