In this invited talk for the Selenium Day I presented an overview of the 
technical innovations that have led to modern machine learning successes with
language processing. This involved discussing what is special about processing
text, the fundamentals of recurrent processing, the development of attention
and self-attention models, and finally how this led to the Transformer architecture.
