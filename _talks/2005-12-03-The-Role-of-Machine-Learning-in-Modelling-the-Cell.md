Talk given for the students of the complex systems masters course
at the University of Mexico City.

In this presentation I discussed the role that machine learning can 
play in modelling complex systems like the biological cell. I discussed
how these algorithms can be used to model probability distributions
and behavior of individual compenents that are then used in Monte
Carlo simulations or agent based models.
