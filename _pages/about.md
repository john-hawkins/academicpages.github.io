Dr. John Hawkins is a data scientist with Boston based automated machine learning company [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com)
and an affiliate researcher at the University of Sydney - Centre for Translational Data Science. 
He has worked across multiple industries applying machine learning to busienss problems and published in the applications of 
machine learning to biological sequence classification and bioinformatics in general. 

His current research interests are in neural networks, Bayesian methods and variations of gradient boosting.


Projects
==============

## Bayesian Neural Networks for Time Series Modelling

Exploring variations on the design of Bayesian neural networks to make optimal usage of time series data and mitigate the 
influence of noisy and uniformative events in historical data.


Collaborators: Dr. Rohitash Chandra & Prof. Sally Cripps, Centre for Translational Data Science.
