and an affiliate researcher at the University of Sydney - Centre for Translational Data Science. 
He has worked across multiple industries applying machine learning to business problems and published research in the application
of machine learning to solve problems in molecular biology. 

His current research interests are in Bayesian neural networks and variations of the gradient boosting algorithm.


Projects
==============

## Bayesian Neural Networks for Time Series Modelling

Exploring variations on the design of Bayesian neural networks systems to make optimal usage of time series data and mitigate the 
influence of noisy and uniformative events in historical data.


Collaborators: Dr. Rohitash Chandra & Prof. Sally Cripps, Centre for Translational Data Science.
